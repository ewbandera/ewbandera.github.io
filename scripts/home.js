'        I am a Technical and Analyst and Software Developer based in Southern Illinois.  Currently I’m employed by Consolidated Electrical Distributors writing code to assist in back-end supply chain integrations.  Most of my formal education has been in music and I have a MM in music theory and composition and a BM in performance for the classical guitar.  However, I have continued my education in information technology consistently.  As well as having software developer certificates in C# and PHP, I also have acquired a Comp Tia A+ certification and CBCA credential.  Currently I am enrolled in the MIT xPRO Software Developer program.'+
